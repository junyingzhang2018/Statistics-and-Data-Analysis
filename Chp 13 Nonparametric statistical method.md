# Chp 13 Nonparametric statistical method

## 1. Sign test for the median of one group

## 2. Wilcoxon signed rank test for median of one group (needs data to be symmetric)

## 3. Independences for two independent samples

Wilcoxon rank sum test and Mann and Whitney U-test
## Wilcoxon signed rank test
`wilcox.test(x, y = NULL, alternative='two.sided', mu=200, conf.level = 0.95)`

`wilcox.test(x, y, alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = 0.95)`
## 4. Inference for several independent samples
Kruskal-Wallis test~CHISQ(a-1), a is the number of groups

## 5. Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kendall rank correlation coefficient
